*operator-user* is a Vim library plugin to provide an easy way to define your
own |operator|.  Though there are several pitfalls to define operators, you
don't have to take care of them with |operator#user#define()| which are
provided by this library plugin.

For example, the following code defines operator "_" to adjust the height of
the current window to the same as the target range:

	map _  <Plug>(operator-adjust)
	call operator#user#define('adjust', 'Op_adjust_window_height')
	function! Op_adjust_window_height(motion_wiseness)
	  execute (line("']") - line("'[") + 1) 'wincmd' '_'
	  normal! `[zt
	endfunction

You can use this operator as follows:

	10__	Adjust to 10 lines and show the current line at the top.
	_ip	Adjust to the same height of the paragraph under the cursor.

This operator is useful to adjust the visible content in the current window.
